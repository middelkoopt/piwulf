# Piwulf
Warewulf on the Pi

**WARNING: This image may erase any machine plugged into the same Ethernet network.**

This project is for deploying a Raspberry Pi cluster with Warewulf.

The bootstrap image is strictly not necessary and can be accomplished by
manually configuring the Warewulf node (head) manually based on the Warewulf
container.  All the interesting bits for provisioning a Raspberry Pi are in the
Warewulf container support and script files and could be run on any machine.
